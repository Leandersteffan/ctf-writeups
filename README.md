# CTF Writeups - Leander Steffan

Hi, I’m Leander. I solve CTFs and write clear, reproducible walkthroughs so other people can learn the techniques, repeat the steps, and fall in love with cybersecurity.

My goal with this repository is simple: teach by example. Every writeup is written so a motivated beginner can follow along, reproduce the exploit, and understand the why behind each step. I keep things practical: TL;DRs up front, exact commands, and small scripts where helpful.

## Who this is for
- People learning offensive security who want step-by-step examples.  
- Developers who want to understand common vulnerabilities.  
- Anyone curious about how real exploits are found and fixed.
- And yes, people who just want to know the answer to a CTF at 2AM (no judgment).

## What you’ll find here
- Short, focused writeups in Markdown with a tiny metadata header.  
- Reproducible steps and small PoC scripts where useful.  
- Lightweight formatting - nothing fancy, just practical and readable.

## How to use this repo
1. Open `writeups/` → choose a platform folder (e.g., `tryhackme`, `web`, `pwn`) → pick a challenge folder → read `writeup.md`.  
2. Each writeup has a TL;DR at the top, the commands I used, the exploit code, and a short mitigation note.  
3. If a challenge needs large files (VM images, PCAPs), the writeup links to a hosted download and includes a checksum — I don’t commit large binaries directly.

## Contributing / Use
- If you spot an error or can make a writeup clearer, please open an issue or send a short message so I can fix it.  
- If you want to contribute in other ways, open an issue first and we’ll coordinate - thank you.  
- If you reuse anything from this repo, check the [LICENSE](LICENSE) and always include a clear reference back to the original (e.g. Github Link).

**Why this matters.** Good security is shared security. If one clear writeup helps even one person understand a vulnerability and fix it, it was worth writing.
